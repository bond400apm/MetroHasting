This project is to estimate the natrual log base(e) using Likelihood method.
I draw the sample from resulting posterior using MetroHasting algorithm

Run main.py to see resulting plots
All the supporting functions and classes are stored in lib directory

Because of the small sample, the randomness lead to different best fit for different run
